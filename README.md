## Dice Roller
### Day04 Dice_roller
I'm sure you have played Ludo more than once in your lifetime. What happen when you touch the dice? It rolls and comes a ramdon number. It can be 2, or maybe it can be 6 or 1. No one know the next number. Based on that concept, I have made a dice_roller concept where the number of picture or dice rolls randomly when you click roll button. Like the Ludo, here the next number is random which bring fun in practice.
